# DuckHunt Proposal
 
## What is DuckHunt?

DuckHunt game or something similar to that, that is playable in the DOM. 

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
- Static background with a usage of sprites/gif to animate the different elements
- Scoring system could be based on lives, timer, or amount of misses
- Being able to make different sprites move across the screen at the same time or at random
- Gun or shooting mechanism that would remove a element from the screen if a the user clicks on it
- Change the cursor into possibly a image that is like a cross-hair

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
