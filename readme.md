# [Name of Game] Proposal
 
## What is [name of game]?

Memory matching game, in which you test a users ability to remember the layout of a webpage.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
- I'll mostly likely need to create a matrix or grid system to keep track off matching pairs.
- Scoring system could be based on lives or a timer 

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

## Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
