# DuckHunt or SideScrollGame Proposal
 
## What is DuckHunt / or SideScrollGame?

DuckHunt game would be a game, in which the player has to kill as much duck as possible without either missing or going against a timer.

For a side-scroll game it would be something similar to jetpack joyride in which a player has to avoid obstacles, collect coins, and power ups.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
- Static background with a usage of sprites/gif to animate the different elements
- Scoring system could be based on lives, timer, or amount of misses
- Being able to make different sprites move across the screen at the same time or at random
- Gun or shooting mechanism that would remove a element from the screen if a the user clicks on it
- Change the cursor into possibly a image that is like a cross-hair

-

## Phases of Completion

- Create basic dom layout
- Able to make targets fly across the screen at random heights and time intervals
- Able to click on a target and update a score
- Able to track the mouse for optional game effects such as a tracking system that makes the targets avoid the mouse
